Web Stack Debugging Project Postmortem: The Great Widgetify Hiccup

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: February 15, 2024, 08:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: February 15, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
Impact:
The Widgetify service decided to take a morning siesta, leaving users in the lurch with a 503 error.
Around 75% of our users joined the "Where did Widgetify go?" support group.
Timeline:

Detection Time: February 15, 2024, 08:00 AM (UTC)
Detection Method: Our vigilant monitoring system poked us with a "Hey, your server is napping!" alert.
Actions Taken:

The investigation began faster than the coffee machine could brew a cup.
Initial assumption: The server was practicing for the limbo competition, seeing how low it could go.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially suspected a disgruntled intern trying out some "innovative" coding techniques.
Considered the possibility of a ghost in the machine, but our exorcism skills were a bit rusty.
Escalation:

The incident escalated faster than our morning caffeine intake to the DevOps and Backend Engineering teams.
Resolution:

The root cause was revealed: the database connection pool was hosting a wild party, inviting way too many connections.
Immediate resolution involved throwing some cold water on the database, figuratively speaking, by adjusting the connection pool settings.
Adding a Dash of Humor:

We considered sending the database connection pool to a spa for some relaxation, but the server didn't appreciate the idea of a pool party.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Added more monitoring than a paranoid security guard to catch any misbehaving database connections.
Implemented automated database scaling to teach it to handle mood swings.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement Enhanced Monitoring:

Task: Gave our monitoring tools a promotion and asked them to keep an eye on the database's stress levels.
Automate Database Scaling:

Task: Taught the database to scale gracefully when faced with a sudden popularity boost.
Review Connection Pool Settings:

Task: Scheduled regular connection pool therapy sessions to ensure it doesnâ€™t hog all the connections.
Conclusion:
In the grand scheme of server hiccups, this one was more of a burp. With our newfound wisdom and a more zen database, Widgetify promises to stay awake and responsive, leaving the siestas to the Spaniards.
